For telecom operators, offering subscription bundles increases the value of their network services, reduces churn rates and enables customers to manage their subscriptions in one place, too.These dynamics explain the bumper annual recurring revenue growth reported by Aim-traded mobile payment platform provider Bango (BGO:115p). Specifically, its digital vending machine (DVM) service enables customers of telecom companies to manage and pay for all their subscriptions in a single place and on one bill.In the first half, Bango signed four new DVM contracts, including one with a Latin American bank, extended an existing contract with a European telecoms operator, and added 13 subscription content providers to its DVM service to take the total past 100 for the first time. Ultimately, DVM exists to allow content owners to grow and expand, hence why it is increasingly the platform subscription content providers are choosing. For instance, the international taxi group Uber joined the Bango DVM to help drive the adoption of its Uber One subscription service (food delivery, taxi rides).Growth from the group’s DVM enterprise-grade solution explains Bango’s 159 per cent net revenue retention rate – a measure of the retention and expansion of revenue from existing customers – from a high-margin business segment that boasts a gross margin of 95 per cent and is becoming an increasingly important part of the group.”",2025-05-28 01:41:30.442,https://www.lse.co.uk/profiles/icb888/

That may seem a stretch, but the business has relatively flat operating expenditure and is highly operationally geared. It means that the drop-through of incremental gross profit to cash profit is accentuated in a strong revenue cycle and one that will benefit from an increasing contribution from the DVM high-margin business.The directors have confidence in hitting analysts’ full-year pre-tax profit estimate of $5.2mn, which underpins their earnings per share (EPS) forecast of 5.9¢. Expect second-half cash flow to drive down net debt from $5.1mn to $2.9mn by the year-end, too. On this basis, Bango’s enterprise valuation to cash profit multiple is only 7.3 times, or less than half that of peers (Boku (BOKU), Fonix Mobile (FNX) and Eagle Eye Solutions ( EYE)).So, having upgraded my recommendation at the annual results (‘Why Bango’s share price is set to recover strongly’, 8 April 2024), I see the profit taking since the pre-close trading update (‘This payment business's re-rating has further to run’, 16 July 2024) as a repeat buying opportunity.

Singer says:“Investors’ focus on Bango’s near-term profitability is of course legitimate, but in-so-doing, this has driven the stock to levels, which undervalues the company’s strong top-line progress, especially that of its DVM business, which grew ARR +130% y/y to $12.9m, thanks to growing uptake from blue-chip logos, such that 3 of the largest 5 US telco’s are now customers. Not only does this demonstrate DVM is an enterprise grade solution, but also highlights Bango’s growth potential – both with existing customers and the broader market. Highlighting this, we believe there is significant growth potential, just from existing logos and - alongside a consistent DCB business - $80m/revs is an achievable medium-term target. “And “Providing BGO successfully executes in H2, then the optics should radically change, and so too the share price. “",2025-05-28 01:41:30.446,https://www.lse.co.uk/profiles/iwantthatone/

Adding 6% growth (per H1) to H2 ‘23 payments revenue would get us to $34.6m, to which we add the H1 ‘24 DVM etc revenue of $7.7m. That’s $42.3m in total, meaning we need c$11m DVM etc in H2. That should be achievable given the pace of growth, illustrated by the ARR. In FY ‘22 ARR was $5.0m against revenue of $10.2m. In FY ‘23 the corresponding figures were $8.8m and $13.4m. At HY 24 the ARR was $12.9m - suggesting the year’s revenue could easily be high teens, as required. I think once the annual trading statement is released in January ‘25 it’ll be game on again here. Until then I expect there’s a lot of caution about whether they can do it. Not helped by the company’s pathetic PR machine.",2025-05-28 01:41:30.446,https://www.lse.co.uk/profiles/iwantthatone/

Aston Martin is quite a different and unique business, because although it has been trading for 112 years, it has almost never reported a pre-tax profit.  The continual problem being spending has always exceeded income, but each time cash becomes a problem more is obtained, either as at present by issuing more shares, or in the past by being rescued by enthusiastic wealthy saviours.  Serious investors want steady, continuous growing earnings, to provide an opportunity of producing a positive return on their investment.With Aston Martin, it has been more rewarding to own one of their cars, than own part of the business.  You can now find extremely well cared for Vantages or DB9s, for very tempting prices.
