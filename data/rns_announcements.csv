By Order of the Board Paula Bell Chief Financial & Operations Officer 4 March 2025 Appendix B: Related party transactions Remuneration of key management personnel - The remuneration of the directors, who are the key management personnel of the Group, is disclosed in the Report on directors' remuneration. There were no other material related party transactions during the year ended 31 December 2024. Appendix C: Principal risks and uncertainties A - Macroeconomic change Spirent is a global business exposed to current world economic conditions and political and trade embargo uncertainties over which it has no control. We saw good growth in EMEA and some recovery in North America in the second half of 2024 offset by a decline in Asia Pacific, which was principally as a result of macroeconomic factors in China. We have navigated regulatory changes throughout the year and continue to work closely with our customers. Trade compliance issues continue to remain a focus, particularly with China. The business is also exposed to government spending priorities, principally in the United States. The residual effects of the COVID-19 crisis, the war in Ukraine, inflationary pressures, and a higher interest rate environment have combined to create uncertainty to current world economic conditions and government spending priorities. The Group continues to monitor the impact to the global economy and possibility of a prolonged recession in the organisation's key markets. Potential impact Deterioration in economic conditions and a change to the terms of conventional international trade and embargoing of specific customers may lead to a reduction in the level of demand for Spirent's products and services and cause customers to delay their purchasing decisions. Mitigating actions The Group closely monitors both market and geographic trends in order to respond to changes in demand and be in a position to take timely actions to protect profitability where possible. In addition, Spirent has a large number of geographically diverse customers, which may mitigate the impact of issues in any one area. B - Technology change Spirent sells complex solutions in industries that can be subject to rapid and somewhat cyclical technological changes. Testing new technologies drives our business, but the opportunity also brings high risk since keeping at the forefront of these key future technologies is critical to our success and to ensuring that we remain competitive in our markets. It is critical that our product development investment is directed at the right areas in order to deliver the solutions that our customers need when they need them. Spirent's success is dependent in part on proprietary technology which may be infringed by others. Open-source tools remain prevalent in providing some of the functionality of our products. Potential impact If product development investment does not keep pace with the speed of change in technologies, or if it is not directed at the right key areas, our competitive position and financial performance will suffer. If Spirent's solutions take longer to develop than anticipated or longer to develop than our competitors, then our competitive position and financial performance will also suffer. Changes in technologies and increasing scrutiny on compliance, security and and Procedure. Spirent has mitigation plans for each of the TCFD physical risks identified, that have been developed as part of longstanding business continuity and disaster recovery plans. Spirent engineering centres are situated across the globe, allowing flexibility and agility should one site become affected. Where possible we have second source component supply to assist with the mitigation of interruptions in supply and regular meetings are held with contract manufacturers. In addition, the Group's largest manufacturing subcontractor has multiple worldwide sites and comprehensive business continuity plans. The Group has appropriate business interruption insurance in place. We are working closely with our contract manufacturers and are in frequent direct consultation with key component suppliers worldwide to mitigate the impact of any supply chain challenges. The situation is dynamic and we will take appropriate action to mitigate the supply chain risk including the careful management of planning and fulfilment. During 2024, we continued with a programme of work to enhance technical controls, processes and procedures in the area of cybersecurity. Third party providers are used in both the testing and monitoring of our security profile. D - Customer dependence/customer investment plan The Group sells its products and services to a wide range of companies and continually seeks to expand its customer base. In 2024, no one customer accounted for more than 10 per cent of Group revenue, although the top ten customers represented 34.1 per cent of Group revenue (2023 34.4 per cent). In some of our markets certain customers have a dominant market share, which makes doing business with these customers and their suppliers critical to the success of our business. In addition, many of the companies with which we do business are some of the largest global telecommunications corporations. Therefore, meeting our development obligations, producing high-quality products and being on time are vital to Spirent's reputation and success. Changes in our major customers' priorities in technology investments can also have a significant impact on their spending on Spirent products and on those in the customers' supply chain. The industry continues to experience consolidation which does disrupt the spending patterns of affected customers. As a result of the current macroeconomic uncertainty, customer spending patterns remain uncertain, particularly in our telecommunications markets. The Group is taking steps to evolve its go-to-market strategy in order to strengthen relationships with customers and diversify its customer base. Potential impact Loss of one or more of Spirent's major customers could have a significant impact on Spirent's financial results. Spend on Spirent's products is often capital in nature and so customer spend can fluctuate significantly from year-to-year. Significant failings in either quality or being able to deliver in the appropriate timescale could cause long-lasting damage to Spirent's reputation and relationships. Over recent years there has been significant consolidation in our customer base amongst service providers and network equipment manufacturers. This trend continues and often results in delays in spending, thereby reducing demand for Spirent's solutions and services. It also reduces the potential number of customers to which those solutions and services could be sold. Changes in our customers' technology investments can result in reduced spending on our existing solutions before customers and those in the customers' supply chains increase spending on new technologies. Mitigating actions Strong customer relationships are critical to Spirent. We aim to provide innovative solutions which address our customers' larger business problems with products and services and we place great emphasis on providing professional service and support. One of the Group's strategic objectives is to invest in deepening our customer relationships and our key account management initiatives assist to ensure robust relationships with our largest customers. We place engineers on site with our customers and undertake site surveys of intended plans for the use of test solutions in their business. We seek to establish thought leadership in our industry through participation in standards bodies and industry forums, which in turn creates additional links with customers. Our approach is to play a key part in the wider supply chain to our key service provider customers by aligning with early adopters of technology. We also seek to broaden our customer base to mitigate customer concentration risk, investing in digital marketing, inside sales, field sales and our partner ecosystem to expand the number of new customers that we win. E - Competition Spirent operates in a range of highly competitive niche markets which experience rapid technological change. In order to compete effectively, it is necessary to establish and maintain technological differentiation in our solutions. The Group faces competition from new market start ‑ ups as well as more established and well-resourced companies. Industry consolidation amongst our direct competitors may bring about a shift in competitive advantage. Potential impact Actions by competitors and increased competition can bring about pressure on Spirent's gross margin. These factors could also affect Spirent's competitive position, thereby reducing revenue and consequently affecting financial results. Consolidation continues within our sector, including the ongoing sale process of the organisation to Keysight. The consolidation of competitors may bring opportunities for Spirent but can also change the competitive landscape as competitors are able to leverage product capabilities or sales channels. Mitigating actions The Group's broad solution portfolio, market-leading capabilities and customer focus continue to address this risk. Spirent aims to maintain market-leading positions through significant investment in the development of differentiated products. We also seek opportunities for attractive inorganic investments that can strengthen our competitive advantage. Competitor activity is closely monitored with a view to maintaining clear differentiation based on Spirent's products, services, and global reach. F - Employee skill base Employees are crucial to the success of our business. Attracting and retaining highly qualified and skilled employees is essential to enable the Group to deliver on its strategy and to the success of the business. Due to the ongoing Keysight sale process challenges are being experienced with retention in some areas of the business and additional steps have been taken to mitigate this risk. Potential impact Competition for personnel is faced from other companies and organisations and the loss of key employees, the failure to attract and retain other highly skilled employees, or the failure to adequately plan for succession may impair Spirent's ability to run and expand the business effectively. Mitigating actions Investing in people is at the core of the Group's strategy. The aim is to find, keep and engage the highest calibre of employees and encourage their contribution and development. An environment that fosters innovation and collaboration is critical to Spirent's success, as is ensuring incentive plans are competitive. We have refined our employee value proposition and continue to make Spirent a more inclusive, diverse and engaging place to work to attract and retain talent. Succession planning for senior posts in the Company is reviewed periodically by the Board. Appropriate career paths, professional development plans, and internal recognition programmes are developed for both technical and non-technical staff. Regular reviews are performed to ensure equitable pay practices and that all elements of compensation across the Group are competitive with the market.

Our market drivers remain intact and, as a result, we continue to invest in and deliver our product roadmap. | First quarter orders and revenue were both in line with our plan and in line with the same period last year. We also maintained our strong orderbook. | In the first quarter, our Positioning business won an industry first contract, utilising new IP to simulate the lunar environment, an expanding and exciting area of space exploration. We saw some slight delays for our assurance solutions, however this was offset by strong demand for high-speed Ethernet due to growing demand for 800G, our new AI solution and support for data centre builds. | We are carefully reviewing tariff changes and, as they come into effect, we will take mitigating actions including customer surcharges and logistical changes to our global sourcing and delivery routes. We will continue to monitor any potential impacts on customer buying patterns and order timings. | We have maintained a strong balance sheet with our cash position closing at $149 million at the end of March 2025, demonstrating continued effective cash management. | Update on the recommended cash offer by Keysight Technologies, Inc. | On 28 March 2024, the Boards of Keysight Technologies, Inc.

Accordingly, Conditions 3.3, 3.4, 3.5 and 3.6 set out in Part A of Part III of the Scheme Document have been satisfied. Completion of the Transaction remains subject to the satisfaction or (if capable of waiver) waiver of the remaining conditions to the Transaction set out in Part III of the Scheme Document (the ""Conditions""), including the Condition relating to sanction of the Scheme by the Court. With support and assistance from Spirent, as Keysight announced on 1 April it remains committed to working quickly and constructively with the US Department of Justice and State Administration for Market Regulation of the People's Republic of China to obtain clearance for the Transaction and, as it stated in the same announcement, expects that the Scheme will become effective during the third quarter of Keysight's current fiscal year (period ending 31 July 2025). | Eric Updyke, Chief Executive Officer | E:investor.relations@spirent.com | Paula Bell, Chief Financial & Operations Officer | James Melville-Ross/Humza Vanderman | E:spirent@dgagroup.com | About Spirent Communications plc | Spirent Communications plc (LSE: SPT) a leading global provider of automated test and assurance solutions for networks, cybersecurity, and positioning.

With the publication of this announcement via a Regulatory Information Service, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain. | (""Kazera"", ""the Group""or ""the Company"") | Kazera Global plc (AIM: KZG), the AIM-quoted investment company, is delighted to announcethat, further to its announcement of 24 September 2024, it has now received a comprehensive and favourable ruling in binding arbitration proceedings against the Namibian company, Hebei Xinjian Construction CC (""Hebei""), with a total award of c.US$11.9 million plus costs. | The binding arbitration proceedings, held in Windhoek, Namibia and governed by the dispute resolution provisions of a December 2022 sale agreement, concluded that Hebei had breached its contractual obligations by failing to make full and timely payment to Kazera for the acquisition of Kazera's interest in African Tantalum (Pty) Ltd (""Aftan""). | Hebei has been ordered by the Arbitrator to pay to Kazera: | ·An amount of US$9.2 million | ·Interest in the amount of US$1.6 million accrued up to 8 October 2024 | ·Interest at the rate of 20% per annum on the amount of US$9.2 from 9 October 2024 to date of payment (being US$1.1 million as at 6 May 2025) | ·Full legal and arbitration costs | As at 6 May 2025, the total amount accrued was therefore, US$11.9 million plus costs. | The ruling validates Kazera's consistent position and brings clarity to a complex and long-running contractual dispute. | As announced on 20 December 2022, Kazera entered into an agreement with Hebei for the sale of its entire interest in Aftan, including the transfer of related shareholder loans, for a total consideration of approximately US$13 million, with Kazera retaining 100% of the issued shares in Aftan as security until the consideration is paid in full. Hebei made only partial payments totalling US$4.1 million and, having failed to meet the balance of its obligations despite formal written demand, was in breach of the agreement. | The agreement included binding arbitration in the event of a dispute and Kazera commenced proceedings in September 2024 after repeated attempts to resolve the matter amicably failed. | Dennis Edmonds, Chief Executive Officer of Kazera Global plc commented:""We've always believed in the strength and fairness of our case, and this ruling confirms that. It is therefore a welcome outcome that protects shareholder interests and draws a line under a long-running issue. While the arbitration process hasn't held us back operationally, it has been an unhelpful distraction. We can now move forward with greater clarity and remain focused on unlocking value across the rest of the portfolio. We will now take the necessary steps to recover the full amount we are owed."" | Kazera is now assessing the most effective legal and commercially beneficial avenues to enforce the award and recover the full amount due.

Completion of the sale was subject to receipt of full consideration proceeds. Aftan was deconsolidated from the Company's financial statements with effect from 4 January 2023 because, in accordance with the terms of the sale agreement, it relinquished control of Aftan in favour of the purchaser, Hebei Xinjian Construction Close Corp (""Hebei"") with effect from that date.

Underlying1 UK revenue was +2.6% ahead of the prior year and +1.4% ahead on a same depot basis and International was +17.0% ahead and +14.8% on a same depot basis.

Our paint to order and solid worksurface ranges are generating encouraging attachment rates to kitchen sales. | Digital investment- we are rolling out an enhanced CRM system in H1 to support our depot teams, giving them a deeper understanding of our customers and helping depots manage their relationships to best advantage. Customer adoption rates for our click-and-collect service, launched in H2 last year, were strong as they benefitted from real-time stock availability when shopping for everyday products. | International development- the new leadership team are settling in well and focusing on building out our depot teams' capabilities and driving existing depot sales in France. | Commenting on Howdens' current trading Andrew Livingston, Chief Executive said: | ""We have made a positive start to the year with trading in line with our expectations.

Underlying1 UK revenue was +2.6% ahead of the prior year and +1.4% ahead on a same depot basis and International was +17.0% ahead and +14.8% on a same depot basis.

This includes a new classic 'in frame' timber kitchen family extending the reach of our higher priced kitchen ranges. Our fitted bedroom offering has been extended with 6 further introduced this year. Our paint to order and solid worksurface ranges are generating encouraging attachment rates to kitchen sales. | Digital investment- we are rolling out an enhanced CRM system in H1 to support our depot teams, giving them a deeper understanding of our customers and helping depots manage their relationships to best advantage. Customer adoption rates for our click-and-collect service, launched in H2 last year, were strong as they benefitted from real-time stock availability when shopping for everyday products. | International development- the new leadership team are settling in well and focusing on building out our depot teams' capabilities and driving existing depot sales in France. | Commenting on Howdens' current trading Andrew Livingston, Chief Executive said: | ""We have made a positive start to the year with trading in line with our expectations.

Underlying1 UK revenue was +2.6% ahead of the prior year and +1.4% ahead on a same depot basis and International was +17.0% ahead and +14.8% on a same depot basis. As disclosed with the Full Year results in February there was a later start to FY2025, and this phasing impact partially corrects itself at the end of FY2025 with an additional trading day in December versus the prior year. | On an absolute basis, Group revenue was +1.2% ahead of the prior year and +0.2% higher on a same depot basis. In the UK, it was +0.9% ahead of the prior year and -0.3% lower on a same depot basis and in international it was +14.8% ahead and +12.7% ahead on a same depot basis. We implemented price increases across all geographies at the start of the year. These are being retained at acceptable levels as we continue to maintain the right balance between margin and volume. | Business developments | During the year we will continue to invest in our strategic initiatives as follows: | Depot revamps and relocations- we now plan to open between 20-25 new depots in the UK this year and refurbish around 60 older UK depots. | New product innovation- we will launch 23 new kitchen ranges in 2025 making more colours, styles and finishes available to more budgets. This includes a new classic 'in frame' timber kitchen family extending the reach of our higher priced kitchen ranges. Our fitted bedroom offering has been extended with 6 further introduced this year. Our paint to order and solid worksurface ranges are generating encouraging attachment rates to kitchen sales. | Digital investment- we are rolling out an enhanced CRM system in H1 to support our depot teams, giving them a deeper understanding of our customers and helping depots manage their relationships to best advantage. Customer adoption rates for our click-and-collect service, launched in H2 last year, were strong as they benefitted from real-time stock availability when shopping for everyday products. | International development- the new leadership team are settling in well and focusing on building out our depot teams' capabilities and driving existing depot sales in France. | Commenting on Howdens' current trading Andrew Livingston, Chief Executive said: | ""We have made a positive start to the year with trading in line with our expectations. Our focus remains on implementing our strategic initiatives to support our trade customers, primarily self-employed builders. They are adept at winning business, aided by Howdens' differentiated model and our well incentivised depot teams.
