# Step 1: Domain Table and Metadata Mapping

## Reminder: Overarching System Goal
See README / Project Vision above.

### Task for this step:
- Extract schema from all CSVs (or database tables).
- For each domain, define:
    - Which table(s) belong to this domain?
    - Which fields will be used as main content for embedding, as metadata, and as label?
    - How will tables be joined (e.g. via setup_id, ticker, date)?
- Output a markdown mapping: `domain_table_map.md` listing tables, key fields, and joins per domain.
